# University Management System (C# + SQL Server)

This is a basic desktop application created during my time at university in 2022. It was built using C# and connected to a SQL Server database. The system includes modules for managing students, teachers, and academic programs.

## Technologies

- C# (WinForms)
- SQL Server
- ADO.NET (for database access)

## Features

- Student management
- Teacher management
- Career/degree program registration
- Database-backed operations (insert, update, delete)

## Note

This project was created as part of a learning experience during my studies. I currently do not maintain it, but Iâ€™m including it in my portfolio as a sample of my academic work with C# and SQL Server.

## What I learned (at the time)

- Connecting C# applications to databases
- Building CRUD operations
- Working with forms and user input
